# Readme-Generator

I want to automatically generator a readme file

- I want to ask the user for a title
- I want to ask the user for a decription of the project
- I want to ask the user if there are installation instructions
- I want to ask the user who contributed to the project
- I want to ask the user for github username and email
- I then add this information to readme file and save it
